Toby loved his bicycle more than anything else he owned. It wasnt new, nor was it flashyit was a hand-me-down from his older brother, its red paint chipped in places and the handlebars wrapped in mismatched tape. But to Toby, it wasnt just a bike; it was freedom.

Every afternoon after school, Toby would race out of the house, hop on his bike, and pedal down the winding dirt road behind his neighborhood. The road led to a hidden meadow, a place only Toby seemed to know about. There, hed spend hours exploring, imagining himself as an adventurer on a great expedition. His bike wasnt just transportationit was his trusty steed, carrying him through jungles, deserts, and mountains.
